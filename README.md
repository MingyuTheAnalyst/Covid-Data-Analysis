# Covid-19 Data Analysis

### Project Overview
 
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into vaccinated, infected and death of COVID-19 from Jan, 2020 to Jan, 2024. At the same time, will be focused on developing SQL and Tableau skill by analyzing COVID-19 data. We seek to identify the trends and gain a deeper understanding of the COVID-19.

### Data Sources

COVID-19 Data : Sourced from OurWorldData from Jan, 2020 to Jan 2024. (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL(MSSQL) - Data Exploration, Data Analysis 
- Tableau - Predictive Analysis, Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploration Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the COVID data to answer key questions, such as:

- Case Fatality Rate: What is the death rate from COVID-19 as a percentage of total cases in a specific country, such as Canada?
- Infection Rate Relative to Population: How has the COVID-19 infection rate relative to the population in Canada (or another country) changed over time?
- Countries with Highest Infection Rate: Which countries have the highest infection rates of COVID-19 relative to their population sizes?
- Deaths by Continent: What are the highest COVID-19 death counts across different continents?
- Vaccination Trends: How has the vaccination rate against COVID-19 evolved in a particular country over time?
